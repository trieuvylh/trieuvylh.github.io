- title: "Proximal based strategies for solving discrete Mumford-Shah with Ambrosio-Tortorelli penalization on edges"
  image: 
  description: This work is dedicated to joint image restoration and contour detection considering the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional. Two proximal alternating minimization schemes with convergence guarantees are provided, PALM-AT and SL-PAM-AT, as well as closed-form expressions of the involved proximity operators. A thorough numerical study is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of both numerical schemes as well as comparisons to state-of-the-art Mumford-Shah strategies.
